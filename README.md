# HakidoGame
Here is the Open-Source of my cool game!

You can host it on your website, but please, do not sell it or make money with this template, this Open-Source project was created to help people to learn how to code!

Concerning hosting, services like "000webhost", "Infinity Free" can be used.

To host it, you just need to download the file, place the different files on your server and connect to the website!

If monsters are not your thing, you can find another version of the game only focused on traps here : https://github.com/NoziaTheDev/HakidoGame-TrapsVersion !

To test this game, you can follow this link -> http://hakido.000webhostapp.com
